Introduction  {.storyboard} 
===================================== 


### Summary

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics('./school_safety.png')


```

***
The school shooting that took place in Parkland on February 14, 2018 was an event that shook that nation, and reignited  the conversation around school safety. Unfortunately, Parkland did not originally initiate these conversations. Over the past couple of years there have been numerous school shootings that have fired up the talk around what safety precautions should be put in place to make schools safer.Numerous initiatives have been introduved such as the Federal Commission on School Safey, which has redirected many of their efforts to conversations around mental health, arming specific school staff and stricter discipline policies. However, the way that our nation's school system is designed many of these policy decisions are left at the state, district and school level. Because of the complexities behind how these policies are implemented, there have been numerous debates over gun reform, arming educator and mental health policies. While there have been numerous talks about implementation of different policies, much of the data that is collected to support these policies is spare and inconsistent. This tool will help look into the history behind school shootings and the school safety policies that have been impolemented in Florida and olorado.  http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2018/12/trump-safety-commission-devos-guidance-guns.html

### Motivation

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics('./MSD.png')

```

***
The tragedy that took place in Parkland is an event that hits close to home for me. I was raised in the small town of Parkland. My sisters and I all attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, My youngest sister,  a survivor of the school shooting. I view the hyper focus on school safety initiatives through  the lense of an educator, researcher and concerned family member.  




### Question

How have school policies changed since the tragic shootings of Columbine and Parkland?

There have been over 1300 school shootings since the 1970's

The database compiles information from more than
25 different sources including peer-reviewed studies,
government reports, mainstream media, non-profits,
private websites, blogs, and crowd-sourced lists that
have been analyzed, filtered, deconflicted, and crossreferenced for accuracy.

*** 

The highest count of shot fired derives from shooters that use a combination of different weapons, followed by a rifle. 
The limitations for this data would be that the type of firearm listed was not provided. -different type of of a particular firemarm can shot more rounds-

ECS Reports 


Aspen Institute did a study around Student Discipline and School Safety. There report has indicated that


- Improving school climiate, or overall character or "feel" of the 
  school, can support safer schools.
  
- There is not strong evidentiary base linking increased school safety    to arming teachers. 

- In K-12 public schools there are widespread disparities in   exclusionary discipline by race, gender and disability status.

There have been 18 shootings since 2000 in Florida
30% of shootings were performed by students or former students 
Most Shootings occured on a Wednesday at 46%
2 of the 18 shootings were indiscriminate - the majority were targated towards a specific person. 
There is not gun data for all the shooting. Weapons of choice: handguns. Two of the shootings which require
done with an assault rifle. Those assault rifles were legally purchasewd by the shooter.
