Executive Summary
 
The school shooting that took place in Parkland on February 14, 2018 was an event that shook the nation, and fired up the conversation around school safety. While the federal government does not track data on school shootings, other sources like the Washington Post have collected information on school shootings dating back to the 1970s. They collected many of their resources from open source databases, law enforcement reports and calls to school or police. These senseless  shootings have sparked highly partisan debates over things  like gun reform and arming educators in the classroom. In the year 2018 there were 25 school shootings alone according to their definition of school shooting. Numerous initiatives have been introduced such as the Federal Commission on School Safety. Many of these initiatives have introduced work around school mental health (i.e counselors), school resource officers(SROs) and school security systems. Recently the Education of Commision of the States released a report on K-12 School Safety. The report provides an overview of different laws around school safety plans, safety audits, safety drills, SROs and Weapons in school. I would like to do an analysis of what each state is doing around safety initiatives and how each state compares from one another. I will walk viewers around through a visualization of school shootings throughout the years. I will then go through the several of the different forms of safety measures each states is taking. This tool will detail each state profile on state legislature around armed educators, school resource officers and school safety drills. The state profile will also list the number of school shootings have occured in the state over the years. 
 
Motivation
 
The tragedy that took place in Parkland is an event that hits close to home for me. I was raised in the small town of Parkland. My sisters and I all attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, My youngest sister,  a survivor of the school shooting. I view the hyper focus on school safety initiatives through  the lense of an educator, researcher and concerned family member. 
 
I want to be able to build a tool that can show what other states are doing around school safety. 
 
Data Question
How does School Safety Laws Shift After school Shootings? A look into Colorado and Florida
School Safety is generally broken down into several different interest: (1) School Climate and Culture(2) School Security and Facilities (3) Emergency Preparedness (4) Response and Recovery, and (5) Mental Health. 
I am looking to create a profile for each state that outlines where each state has concentrated their work on school safety since the Parkland shooting.  What policies have been introduced into each state. 
How does each state compare to one another when it comes to having state policies aroun
